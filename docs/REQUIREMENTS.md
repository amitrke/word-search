## 4. AI Integration Approach

### 4.1 ChatGPT Puzzle Generation Prompt

```
Generate a word search puzzle with the following specifications:

Theme: [THEME]
Difficulty: [DIFFICULTY]
Number of words: [NUM_WORDS]
Grid size: [GRID_SIZE]

Please provide:
1. A list of [NUM_WORDS] words related to the theme
2. A brief hint for each word (one sentence)
3. Ensure words are:
   - Appropriate for all ages
   - Clearly related to the theme
   - Varied in length (mix of short and longer words)
   - No proper nouns unless theme-appropriate

Return the response in JSON format:
{
  "words": ["word1", "word2", ...],
  "hints": ["hint1", "hint2", ...]
}
```

### 4.2 Word Placement Algorithm (Server-Side)

The Cloud Function will:
1. Receive word list from ChatGPT
2. Create empty grid of specified size
3. Place words using algorithm:
   - Sort words by length (longest first)
   - For each word, attempt placement:
     - Try all valid directions based on difficulty
     - Ensure no conflicts with existing words (allow letter sharing)
     - Random positioning within grid
   - Fill remaining cells with random letters
4. Store word positions for validation

### 4.3 Difficulty Parameters

| Difficulty | Grid Size | Words | Directions | Word Length | AI Prompt Guidance |
|------------|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Simple     | 8x8       | 5-8   | H, V       | 3-6 chars   | "Use common, simple words" |
| Medium     | 12x12     | 10-15 | H, V, D    | 4-10 chars  | "Use moderately challenging words" |
| Hard       | 15x15     | 15-20 | All + Rev  | 6-12 chars  | "Use advanced vocabulary" |

*H = Horizontal, V = Vertical, D = Diagonal, Rev = Reverse*
