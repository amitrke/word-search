## 🎯 Choose Your Architecture

You have two options for puzzle generation:

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended - FREE)
✅ **Pros**: FREE, stays on Firebase Spark plan, simple setup
❌ **Cons**: Batch generation only (not real-time)
📖 **Guide**: [GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md)

### Option 2: Cloud Functions (Alternative)
✅ **Pros**: Real-time on-demand generation
❌ **Cons**: Requires Firebase Blaze plan ($15-45/month)
📖 **Guide**: [TECHNICAL_SETUP.md](TECHNICAL_SETUP.md) Section 4

**Recommendation**: Start with GitHub Actions (Option 1) to keep costs at $0.50/month

## 📚 Documentation Overview

Your project has three main documentation files:

| Document | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **REQUIREMENTS.md** | Complete feature specifications and architecture | Reference when designing features |
| **TECHNICAL_SETUP.md** | Step-by-step setup instructions | Follow during initial setup |
| **PROGRESS.md** | Detailed implementation checklist | Track daily progress, check off completed tasks |

## 🚀 Quick Start (30 minutes)

Follow these steps to get your development environment ready:

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project (10 min)
```bash
# Visit https://console.firebase.google.com/
# 1. Click "Add project"
# 2. Name it "word-search-app"
# 3. Enable Google Analytics
# 4. Create project
```
✅ **Mark as done in**: `docs/PROGRESS.md` → Setup & Configuration → Firebase Project Setup

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (5 min)
```bash
# Update pubspec.yaml with Firebase dependencies
# (See TECHNICAL_SETUP.md Section 2.1)

flutter pub get
```
✅ **Mark as done in**: `docs/PROGRESS.md` → Setup & Configuration → Flutter Project Configuration

### Step 3: Configure Firebase (10 min)
```bash
# Install FlutterFire CLI
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Configure Firebase
flutterfire configure
# Select your project
# Select platforms (Android, iOS, Web, etc.)
```
✅ **Mark as done in**: `docs/PROGRESS.md` → Setup & Configuration → Flutter Project Configuration

### Step 4: Test App Runs (5 min)
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
# or
flutter run -d windows
```
✅ **Mark as done in**: `docs/PROGRESS.md` → Setup & Configuration → Flutter Project Configuration

## 📋 Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow

1. **Start of Day**
   - Open `docs/PROGRESS.md`
   - Review current phase and week
   - Pick 2-3 tasks to complete today
   - Read relevant sections in TECHNICAL_SETUP.md

2. **During Development**
   - Implement feature
   - Test locally
   - Check off completed items in PROGRESS.md
   - Commit changes: `git commit -m "feat: add puzzle grid widget"`

3. **End of Day**
   - Update progress summary at bottom of PROGRESS.md
   - Note any blockers
   - Plan tomorrow's tasks

### How to Mark Progress

Open `docs/PROGRESS.md` and change:
```markdown
- [ ] Task to complete
```
To:
```markdown
- [x] Task to complete
```

### Git Commit Convention

Use conventional commits to track progress:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement puzzle grid widget"
git commit -m "fix: resolve word selection bug"
git commit -m "docs: update progress tracker"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for puzzle model"
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking Methods

### Method 1: Simple Checkbox (Recommended)
- Open `docs/PROGRESS.md`
- Find the task
- Change `[ ]` to `[x]`
- Save file
- Commit: `git commit -m "docs: update progress"`

### Method 2: Progress Summary
At the bottom of `docs/PROGRESS.md`, update:
```markdown
### Overall Progress: 15%

#### Phase 1 (MVP): 15/100 items completed
```

### Method 3: Git Commits
Your git history serves as progress tracking:
```bash
git log --oneline --all --graph
```

### Method 4: GitHub Projects (Optional)
- Create GitHub Project board
- Import tasks from PROGRESS.md
- Move cards: To Do → In Progress → Done
