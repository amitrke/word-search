## 🎮 How It Works

### Architecture: GitHub Actions (Recommended - FREE!)

1. **Puzzle Generation** (GitHub Actions - Scheduled)
   - GitHub Action runs daily (or on-demand)
   - **Smart inventory management** - only generates when needed
   - Checks puzzle inventory and user consumption rate
   - Calls ChatGPT API with theme and difficulty
   - AI generates themed word list
   - Algorithm places words in grid
   - Batch upload to Firestore
   - **Cost**: $0.25-0.35/month (saves 30-50% vs. always generating)

2. **Puzzle Playing** (Client-side)
   - App fetches pre-generated puzzles from Firestore
   - User selects letters to find words
   - Progress tracked and synced to Firebase
   - Statistics and achievements updated

3. **Daily Challenge** (Scheduled)
   - GitHub Action selects/generates puzzle of the day
   - Updates Firestore daily challenge collection
   - Users compete on leaderboard

**See**: [GitHub Actions Setup Guide](docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md) for implementation

### Alternative: Cloud Functions (Requires Firebase Blaze Plan)
- Real-time on-demand puzzle generation
- User-triggered puzzle creation
- Requires Firebase Blaze plan (~$15-45/month)

## 📈 Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-6)
- Core puzzle generation and playing
- Firebase integration
- User authentication
- Daily challenges
- **Status**: Not started - See [PROGRESS.md](docs/PROGRESS.md)

### ⏳ Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 7-10)
- Achievement system
- Statistics dashboard
- Hint system
- Offline mode
- UI polish

### ⏳ Phase 3: Social (Weeks 11-14)
- Leaderboards
- Friend system
- Share functionality
- Push notifications

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test
flutter test test/models/puzzle_test.dart

# Run with coverage
