# 🚀 Flutter App Setup - Test Your First Puzzle!

Great! Your Flutter app code is ready. Now let's configure Firebase and see your puzzles!

## ✅ What's Done

- ✅ pubspec.yaml updated with Firebase dependencies
- ✅ Puzzle model created
- ✅ PuzzleListScreen created (shows all puzzles)
- ✅ PuzzleScreen created (displays puzzle grid)
- ✅ main.dart updated with Firebase initialization
- ✅ Project structure set up

## 📋 Next Steps (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
flutter pub get
```

**Expected output**:
```
Running "flutter pub get" in word-search...
Resolving dependencies...
+ firebase_core 2.24.0
+ cloud_firestore 4.13.0
...
Got dependencies!
```

### Step 2: Configure Firebase (5 minutes)

```bash
# Install FlutterFire CLI (if not already installed)
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Configure Firebase for Flutter
flutterfire configure
```

**What this does**:
1. Lists your Firebase projects
2. Asks you to select your project
3. Asks which platforms to support (choose web for quick testing)
4. Generates `firebase_options.dart` file automatically

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Flutter application configured successfully!
```

**⚠️ Note**: The file `lib/firebase_options.dart` will be generated. This is already imported in main.dart!

### Step 3: Run the App! (3 minutes)

```bash
# Run on Chrome (fastest for testing)
flutter run -d chrome

# Or on Windows
flutter run -d windows

# Or see all devices
flutter devices
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "firebase_options.dart not found"
**Fix**: Run `flutterfire configure` first

### Error: "No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created"
**Fix**: Make sure Step 2 (flutterfire configure) completed successfully

### Error: "PERMISSION_DENIED"
**Fix**: Your Firestore security rules need to allow reads. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules and temporarily set:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;  // Allow anyone to read (temporary)
      allow write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

### No puzzles showing / Empty list
**Fix**:
1. Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Make sure `puzzles` collection has documents
2. Check you ran the GitHub Actions workflow successfully
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### App builds but crashes immediately
**Fix**: Check the console output for errors. Most likely Firebase isn't configured properly.
